# LINE

Line (Link Insertion Network Enrichment) is an approach that tests a variety of heuristics that calculate the probability of creating new edges in the network to structurally enrich these networks and improve the results obtained by the community detection algorithms.

## Folders:
- Artificial Networks GML - Contains examples of artificial networks generated by the LFR benchmark
- Real Networks GML - Contains examples of real networks

## Files:
- line.py - Contains our approach, with the tested heuristics
- network.py - Contains load and save network functions, functions on the network structure and characteristics, community detection algorithms, and other functions.
- TestLine.ipynb - A simple notebook to test the heuristics present in LINE
